Vitality Complex delivers foundational micronutrients tailored for remote-first teams. It
combines slow-release carbohydrates with adaptogens such as rhodiola to keep energy
levels stable across timezone-shifted workdays.

Clarity Drops help cross-functional squads regain focus before sprint reviews. The formula
uses botanical extracts like lemon balm and bacopa to provide calm alertness without sugar
or jittery stimulants.

Recovery Shield supports high-performing crews during launch windows. Magnesium glycinate
paired with amino acids improves overnight recovery while chamomile and tart cherry
encourage deep, sustained rest.
